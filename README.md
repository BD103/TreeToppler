TreeToppler is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod that _almost_ prevents floating trees, targeting Minecraft 1.20.2.

As compared to other realistic falling tree mods, this does not add any fancy falling animations or even a vein-miner-like system. Instead, this mod prevents floating trees by giving logs falling sand / gravel physics. Yes, _all_ logs. If you couldn't tell, this is a joke mod that is not meant to be taken seriously nor used in actual worlds. It will make building with logs nearly impossible, but at least you can use a torch to "chop" down an entire tree!
